It’s possible that an 411cash can exceed 100 percent. If you’re purchasing a car or vehicle but you currently have a loan where you owe more than the car is worth – and you want to roll it over into a new loan for a new vehicle – your loan amount will increase.

If you’re looking at a $2,000 car and have no money available for a down payment, and have $5,000 remaining on any existing car loan, you need to pay off the unpaid balance before getting a new loan. The dealer may offer to roll the unpaid balance into the new loan, which could create another negative equity situation down the road or make it more difficult to get a new loan: 411cash
